# Coffee for Children 

Once I was late for press conference, but, luckily, when I arrived it wasn’t yet started. Turned out, everybody was waiting for me. This was a nice gesture from company’ s PR specialist, to whom earlier that day I sent approval letter saying that I will definitely come.

I wasn’t quite recovered from the pleasant surprise, that I’m enough important to wait those ten minutes, when one of the company’ s representatives asked me if I wanted some coffee.

I politely answered that “It would be nice”, but the next question caught me unaware. He asked me, “Do you drink children coffee?”

I was speechless. I glanced around, and clearly I was one of the youngest in the room. I didn’t know how to react, what to answer and if it was an obvious joke about my age. So I just stared at this guy.

Thankfully, after few seconds of weird silence, he explained – he meant to ask – whether I drank coffee with milk.


#  Journalism Hardships

As a student I had wide variety of chances to meet journalists. Excellent journalists – those who write heart touching interviews, those who are digging up dirt and making the difference, editors who are running the whole show and so on.

In short, they came to university, told about their job, they presented their viewpont on good journalism and shared with students the most amusing and outrageous moments from their work history.

Very clean and polished version of the job description.

What I think would be a great lesson for journalism students? A real-time, no-holding-back journalist’ s meltdown. Somebody, who have had nine hours workday; completely devastated, hungry because he had to wait for three extra hours while the government have a closed meeting discussing nationally important decision. Then, when the meetings over – get two short, meaningless sentence with a zero informational value, but the icing on the cake? He had to write bullshitty news item of it in the end.

Oh, that would be a GREAT guest lecture!

But the thing is – journalists are a very special breed. They don’t breakdown that easily.
