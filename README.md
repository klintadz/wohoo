Once I was late for press conference, but, luckily, when I arrived it wasn’t yet started. Turned out, everybody was waiting for me. This was a nice gesture from company’ s PR specialist, to whom earlier that day I sent approval letter saying that I will definitely come.

I wasn’t quite recovered from the pleasant surprise, that I’m enough important to wait those ten minutes, when one of the company’ s representatives asked me if I wanted some coffee.

I politely answered that “It would be nice”, but the next question caught me unaware. He asked me, “Do you drink children coffee?”

I was speechless. I glanced around, and clearly I was one of the youngest in the room. I didn’t know how to react, what to answer and if it was an obvious joke about my age. So I just stared at this guy.

Thankfully, after few seconds of weird silence, he explained – he meant to ask – whether I drank coffee with milk.
